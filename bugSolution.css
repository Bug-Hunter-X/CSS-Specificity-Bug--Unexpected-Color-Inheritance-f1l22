To solve the specificity issue and ensure the paragraph text within the div is green, you can increase the specificity of the `div p` selector by adding another selector:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div > p {
  color: green; /* Increased specificity by using the child combinator > */
}
```

Using the child combinator `>` ensures that the style only applies to direct children of the `div`, and guarantees that the rule with higher specificity overrides both previous styles. This change ensures consistent behavior across various browsers.
